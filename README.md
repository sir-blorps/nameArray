This was a personal project I did as practice for my Intro to Java class. It's got a few mistakes but still works (one being instead of making a new class I just bundled it all into one).
Feel free to mess around with it!

changes: 
5/2/2025: I changed the program up a bit. Make userNameEnter a separate class and allows the program to loop indefinitely so long as doNotExit remains true.
